<h2> Project Title </h2>

**Performance Evaluation of Off-grid Mesh Network
Communication using goTenna and Meshtastic**

<h2> Research Problem Statement </h2>

There has been a steady development in mesh networking in the past decade. This technology enables mobile, long-range connectivity even without cell, wifi or satellite connectivity. goTenna is arguably the world's leading mobile mesh networking company, providing off-grid connectivity solutions for smartphones and other devices, as well as augmenting traditional communications networks. The technology could be of use to firefighters, military operations, local law enforcement, search and rescue.

An alternative approach is the open source project called 'Meshtastic' to be an easy to use mobile ad-hoc mesh network that can be accessed by people without the need to have specific hardware or pre-downloaded software (such as a mobile app). The network is made up of multiple nodes such as smartphoneand Web CLI. They can be set up with cost-effective components such as ESP32 boards, antenna and GPS modules.

There is a huge disparity in price between the two approaches, however they share the common goal: Establishing means of communication in a challenging environment without cell or WiFi access.

What we would like to do, therefore, is to explore the core technology of the two approaches then evaluate their performance in an indepth manner.

<h2> Research Novelity </h2>

goTenna came up with an idea after [Hurricane Sandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy "Hurricane Sandy") knocked out 25 percent of [cell towers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_towers "Cell towers"), and caused outages for 25 percent of [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") services, across 10 states on the [East Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States "East Coast of the United States"). Currently, goTenna is supplied to military service, border security and rescue. Mesh is an open source and it aims to provide mesh network easily with ESP32 chip. Also, the way goTenna sends messages through UHF is similar with Meshtastic. 
The reason why this topic is novelty is that there are several papers writen about goTenna and Meshtastic, however, there aren't any papers comparing their performances and evaluating in different testing environments.
Determining the weakness and strength between two products in different environment will become a significant research achievement.
